This project was developed with the information I gained from Murat Yücedağ's Udemy courses titled "Let's Develop a Dynamic Portfolio with Admin Panel with Asp.NET Core Part1 and Part2 ". 
Although it was a beginner level Asp.NET Core project, it significantly increased my theoretical and practical knowledge. This project increased my self-confidence in stepping into software projects. 

Technologies Used in the Project 
•	C# programming language 
•	Asp.NET Core 8.0
•	Microsoft SQL Server 
•	Entity Framework (Code First & Migration)
•	MVC (Model-View-Controller)
•	HTML
•	CSS 
•	Bootstrap

Firstly, I used a template for web UI. Folder structure was used the most part of the project.  I used code first approach in Entity Framework. I created entities and I completed the migration process. Then, I increased the readability and reusability of the code by using view component and partial view. I made the project dynamic by using the data in the model layer in the View and Controller layers. In the admin panel of this project, I followed the same steps. In the Dashboard section, I dynamically retrieved some statistical data from the database. After that, I created CRUD operations using Controller. Finally, I completed the final edits. I will revise this project. 

This was a very nice training and project for me. I would like to thank Murat Yücedağ for providing us with such an opportunity.
